###Healthcare costs are rising steadily, and individuals often struggle to estimate their potential medical expenses or decide whether health insurance is necessary. Young, healthy users may underestimate the need for insurance, while high-risk individuals may not realize how costly going uninsured can be.

Traditional insurance quote systems are often opaque, generic, and lack personalization. There is a need for a tool that can:

Accurately estimate annual medical charges based on personal health and lifestyle factors.

Provide personalized advice on whether to consider buying insurance.

Help users understand how risk factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and dependents affect costs.

Offer a clear, data-driven, and user-friendly experience with downloadable summaries for future reference.
